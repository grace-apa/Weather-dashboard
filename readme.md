The challenge was to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

Links to an external site. to retrieve weather data for cities. base URL for your API calls should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}.

The weather dashboard allows the user to do the following:

- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

The city name

The date

An icon representation of weather conditions
